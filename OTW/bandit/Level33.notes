This .bashrc starts us out in a shell that converts all STDIN to uppercase text.
Since it is an interactive shell, we can use the bash variable "$0" to execute a new shell
Once we escape the uppercase shell we can run a "/bin/bash -i" to get back into an interactive shell where TAB-Completion works and were not stuck in uppercase.
