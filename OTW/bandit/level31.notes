After creating a temp directory in /tmp/bandit30 , we can navigate to that folder and clone our repository

git clone bandit30-git@localhost:/home/bandit30-git/repo

After looking at the README.md and the "git log" there is no evidence of a password.  Git has tagging features as well.  Lets check the tags

bandit30@bandit:/tmp/bandit30/repo$ git tag
secret
bandit13@bandit:/tmp/bandit30/repo$ git show secret
